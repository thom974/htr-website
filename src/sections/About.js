      Hack The Ridge is Iroquois Ridge High School’s annual hackathon and pitch
      competition where students collaborate to come up with solutions to
      real-world problems. The event is taking place virtually, on Saturday,
      December 11th, 2021, from 9 AM to 9 PM. Workshops and guest speakers will
      be helping participants to expand their skill sets, which can not only be
      applied during the event but also onwards. During the event, participants
      will form teams of up to four people (though forming a team is not
      mandatory) and have a choice between the following:
      <b>
        come up with a creative technological solution to any real-world problem
        of your choice, or pitch a practical business idea that will thrive in
        today{"'"}s demanding ecosystem.
