You can visit our site [here.](https://www.ridgehacks.xyz/)

The website was built with the **Next.js** web framework using **React**, **Chakra UI** and **GSAP**. The 3D web graphics library **Three.js** was extensively used to create the featured 3D scene on the site. Custom WebGL shaders were written in **GLSL** and all models were self-made.
